# Image_Classification (in progress)
This deep learning model trains a convnet to perform face-mask image recognition.  This is an unbalanced binary classification project using Python and concepts from the book 'Deep Learning With Python' by Francois Chollet (2008).  
The dataset has been used for a Kaggle competition and consists of over 10,000 files; https://www.kaggle.com/wobotintelligence/face-mask-detection-dataset
