# Image_Classification
This deep learning model using Python trains a convnet to perform face-mask image recognition.  This is an unbalanced binary classification project using Python and concepts from the book 'Deep Learning With Python' by Francois Chollet (2008).  While the coding for the project was not successful, the potential applications in high reliability organizations (such as health care) might not yet be fully realized, making this a worthy data storytelling project.
The dataset has been used for a Kaggle competition and consists of over 10,000 files; https://www.kaggle.com/wobotintelligence/face-mask-detection-dataset
